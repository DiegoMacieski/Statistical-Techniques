# Statistical-Techniques

This repository contains my work for the Continuous Assessments (CA1 & CA2) in the Statistical Techniques for Data Analysis module, part of the HDip in Science in Data Analytics for Business at CCT College Dublin.

Project Overview

These assessments focused on applying descriptive statistics, probability theory, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis using Python.

CA1 – Exploratory Data Analysis & Probability

✔️ Explored a dataset containing categorical and numerical variables.
✔️ Descriptive Statistics – Summarized key insights using measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.
✔️ Data Visualization – Created histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
✔️ Probability Analysis – Solved problems involving Binomial, Poisson, and Normal distributions.

CA2 – Hypothesis Testing & Regression Analysis

✔️ Conducted hypothesis tests for means and associations in real-world datasets.
✔️ Applied correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables.
✔️ Built and evaluated regression models to predict outcomes.

Technologies Used
	•	Python (Jupyter Notebook)
	•	Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation
	•	Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization
	•	SciPy & Statsmodels – Hypothesis testing & regression
